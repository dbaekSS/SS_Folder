1. LocalDateTime class

2. Using TemporalAdjuster you can look for the previous Thursday of the current date being looked at.
LocalDate lastThursday = localDate.with(TemporalAdjusters.previous(DayOfWeek.THURSDAY));

3. ZoneId describes a time-zone identifier and gives rules from going from an Instant and LocalDateTime
while ZoneOffSet just describes the difference in two time zones

4. Converting an Instant to ZonedDateTime would be
ZonedDateTime inst = Instant.atZone(ZoneId.of("area of zoneddatetime"))
to convert from ZonedDateTime to Instant use
var.toInstant();

5. Taking a year you can use YearMonth.of(year, month);
Print the YearMonth's .lengthOfMonth(); function for each month

6. Using the year and month as a given, create a date 
with the year, month and a TemporalAdjusters method to get
firstInMonth(DayOfWeek.Monday());
Then use a while look to check if the next(DayOfWeek.MONDAY) is still
in the same month.

7. Using the date as a given, check if the day in the month matches
13th and the day of the week is on friday.
